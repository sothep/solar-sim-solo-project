# solar-sim-solo-project

PVRays is an individually-written MEAN stack application done while at Prime Digital Academy.  It allows the user to simulate solar-photovoltaic installations anywhere in the United States, with orientations, tracking mechanisms, and material qualities of their choosing.  Estimated monthly energy output is graphed for all installations, allowing the user to learn about what factors are important for solar efficiency.

## Some of the technologies used are:
- MongoDB / mongoose
- Node.js
- ExpressJS
- AngularJS (with Angular Cookies and Animations)
- The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) PVWatts API
